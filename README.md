[Great Suspender extension on Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender-origi/ahmkjjgdligadogjedmnogbpbcpofeeo)

*NB: Later I found [The Great Suspender Recovery Tool extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender-recov/ainlmpkfinfbbgdpimmldfdgpenmclmk*) which is more feature-rich!*

- Navigate to Chrome's main menu > More tools > Extensions

- Click "Load unpacked" button & browse for the top folder

##Usage
- Click on the extension toolbar icon to reload the original URLs of all currently suspended tabs
